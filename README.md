# TabletEnhancer
Software for use with digital graphics tablets. It helps visualize the location of the cursor on the screen in case the cursor size is very small (for example when drawing with a very fine pen).

# Usage
Start the application (it runs silently in the backround) and use the graphics tablet as you normally would.
Press F12 to exit the program.
